# Blog-Website-Project
Developed a web-based blogging application using Express.js and Mongoose ODM library in the back end and
Bootstrap and CSS in the front-end. The rendered web-pages were created using EJS templating engine.
Users can perform CRUD operations, add blog specific comments, and perform search queries based on keywords.

This is the outlook of the  website.
